            <h2>Generative Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>
              We chose data topic number 8, generative aesthetics which we defined as a data topic that allows visual aesthetics to be formed using any data. We created Rant to Me, which collects the data of different various individuals' issues and bottled up emotions through our computer generated artefact. Rant to Me allows people to experience therapy in a new form, where the individual creates art whilst interacting with the Rant to Me platform. Our computer generated artefact is simply using voice to generate the unqiue designs that cognates with the participants.

            <h2>Loopers and Coding</h2>
            <p class="p__size-m">
              Eliza found an already made code via a website called "Happy Coding", this website showed a p5js generated design of lines moving in loops. It's colours and movement are programmed to random. This was the kind of generated design we hoped to achieve, however due to the complication of how loopers work, we resorted working with a simple code that we understand its functions.
            </p>
            <p class="p__size-m">
              Although the loopers code, seems to be the ideal randomised line movement we as a group wanted to achieve, we went back to the basics and worked with codes that we can simply understand. Upon consulting with Andreas, he additionally gave us a tutorial on creating a randomised "paint splatter" shape, which helped us use as the maximum volume for our voice interactive p5.js platform.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
              1) coming up with an idea of what we could do with the data topic, generative aesthetics. We came up with 4 different ideas, before working with Rant to Me. The first idea was to create a randomise generated artwork using facial recognition, however upon consulting with Andreas, working with facial recognition and randomised generated artwork is not as simple as it seems, therefore we resulted in adjusting our idea, to utilising voice interaction instead as this is something that Nicole and Kelsey have worked with during semester 2 of year 1. Thus creating Rant to Me - the purpose behind this just fell and worked well with what we wanted to achieve, in which to use generative aesthetics in creating the purpose and artefact itself.

            </p>
            <p>
              3) having to coordinate with each other's schedule outside of class. It was a struggle for us, as two of our memebers, caught covid, which is an issue that we could not forsee as we live in a society where covid exist. Thus we overcame this problem, by meeting via google meets at the time that we are all avaiable. This worked well for this project as our artefact is digitalised.

          <div class="column__half default__content">
            <p> 2) finding the code that would help create the randomised generated artwork we wanted. Going over old js sketches and other people's js sketches, we resulted with working with something simple as mentioned above, loopers is a complex code that needs time and effort in understanding how each lines of code work.</p>
