              In today’s society, mental health is slowly becoming more prominent, in which we see advertisements regarding speaking up or seeking professional help. However, there is still slow progress with this as people are still not comfortable with the idea of speaking up about how they feel or any issues they are facing. As a group, we searched online articles regarding this issue, in order to gain a better understanding and came across an article about teenagers’ mental health. It stated how teenagers are extremely comfortable in sharing their raw emotions through digital means - their coping mechanism. Thus as a group, we decided to work with generative design which utilizes code (p5js) and interaction with the viewer. Click on the following for our subsections  <a href="project/process.html">Process</a>, <a href="project/findings-insights.html">Findings and Insights</a>, and <a href="project/outcomes.html">Outcomes</a>

              A project by Eliza, Nicole & Kelsey. Where as a group, chose number 8, generative aesthetics which led to the creation of Rant to Me.

Rant To Me allows its users to interact with the designed artefact (created using the p5js software) to express their emotions and issues in a private manner and generates various unique digital artworks.
